# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: Object-oriented programming is also known as OOP and for example Ruby is an OOP as everything in Ruby is an object. In regard to functional programming it's in regard to functions working to achieve a value I believe. I would love to research this question more and get back to you. 

Researched answer: OOP uses class as blueprints for objects. Functional programming is a Javascript program (JS is a multi-paradigm language) that has a bunch of different meanings such as avoiding shared state(a variable or object that is shared amongst scopes), mutating state, side effects(when called upon it can be seen outside of the called upon function, not good to have), function composition(taking two functions and joining them together), and pure functions (what you put in returns the same). 

2. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer: A float is when you have the decimal place of atleast one invovled while an integer is just a whole number. For example a float will be 3.0 and an integer will be 3. 

Researched answer: An integer is a whole number and a float is a number that has a decimal place. 

3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: Implicit return is the return of something with no name. Meaning it does not need a return (the words return like JavaScript does). 

Researched answer: In Ruby even if there is no name assigned Ruby will automatically run the last line of the method as again we don't need the words return, Ruby does it automatically for us. 

4. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: A block in ruby is a code block used with a def (define) and an end as every define has an end. This is where you'll execute a .each statement or a .map. 

Researched answer: A block can have a name assigned to it, must be invoked using curly braces, must have a def and a end, and is similar to a method, but you don't have to have a name. 

5. How do you extract a value in a Ruby hash?

Your answer: CRUD is the way I remember anything in Ruby hashes and that stands for create, read, update, or delete so I'm unsure what you mean by extract can you please elaborate on which of those four you would like for me to explain. 

Researched answer: You can extract a hash from Ruby by calling the variable name and the key, for example you have an array of favorite foods. you can call food[:fav_food] and that should return 'pasta'.

# food {fav_food: 'pasta', fav_dessert: 'coffee cafe'} 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. PostgreSQL: open source, object relational database management system, and it is primarly used to store data or data warehouses for things such as web dev, app dev, geospatial, and or analystics apps. 

2. Ruby on Rails: open source, web app dev framework written in the Ruby program language. It's also a server-side web app. 

3. ORM: Object-relational mappig which is used to connect code and relational databases. It's Ruby code that runs between the logic you write (code) and the database. 

4. Active Record: It's the layer of "records" that represent the business data and logic. 

5. Migrations: It's the shifting of data between one system to another using a database or software, maybe similar to the linking of HTML and CSS or JS to HTML.
